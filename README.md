# TRSF

A tool that provides human readable suggestions to terminal errors in real-time. TRSF runs in the background and automatically intercepts cryptic terminal errors, providing clear, actionable explanations.

## Installation

Using `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install trsf
```

## Usage

1. Start the TRSF error interpreter in your terminal:

```bash
trsf
```

2. Continue using your terminal as usual. When an error occurs, TRSF will automatically provide a human-readable explanation:

```bash
$ chmod 777 /etc/hosts
Permission denied: '/etc/hosts'

üîç TRSF Suggestion:
This error occurred because you don't have sufficient privileges to modify system files.
Try running the command with sudo:
  sudo chmod 777 /etc/hosts

Note: Modifying system files can be dangerous. Make sure you know what you're doing!
```

To stop TRSF, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.
